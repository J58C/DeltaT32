# ESP32-C3 Mini-1 Wearable & General-Purpose Board

This repository contains hardware designs based on the **ESP32-C3 Mini-1** module, inspired by the **ESP Rust Board**.  
The board is primarily intended for **wearable applications** featuring **IMU** and **heart rate sensors**, but is also designed to work as a **general-purpose ESP32-C3 development board**.

In the latest version, the ESP board and sensor modules are separated to improve modularity, allowing flexible use for a wide range of IoT and embedded projects.
